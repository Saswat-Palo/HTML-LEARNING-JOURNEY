# HTML-LEARNING-JOURNEY
A step-by-step collection of HTML concepts, examples, and projects as I grow from a beginner to a proficient web developer. 
This repo reflects my learning, practice, and experimentation with HTML.
After learning the whole html I started learning the css also I completed the basics of css.
Using HTML and CSS I made a portfolio for myself and uploaded it in a different repo.
The portfolio is live online.
Thank You for observing my journey.
